# HMR WebSocket Issues - RESOLVED

## Current Status: ✅ FIXED

**Solution Applied**: HMR has been disabled to eliminate WebSocket connectivity issues in the cloud environment.

## What Was Done

1. **Environment Variable Set**: `DISABLE_HMR=true`
2. **HMR Completely Disabled**: No more WebSocket connection attempts
3. **Clean Development Environment**: No more "Failed to fetch" errors

## Current Development Experience

### ✅ What Works Perfectly:
- All API functionality (vet bookings, authentication, services)
- All application features
- MongoDB connectivity
- Backend processing
- User interface and interactions

### ⚠️ Manual Refresh Required:
- After making code changes, manually refresh the browser
- No automatic hot reloading (HMR disabled)

## Re-enabling HMR (if desired)

To re-enable HMR in a more stable environment:
```bash
export DISABLE_HMR=false
```
Then restart the dev server.

### Option 2: Manual Page Refresh
If HMR is disabled or unstable, you'll need to manually refresh the browser after making code changes.

## Why This Happens

- Cloud environments often have unstable WebSocket connections
- Network latency can cause HMR ping timeouts
- Container networking can interfere with WebSocket protocols

## Impact on Development

- **API Functionality**: ✅ Unaffected (works perfectly)
- **Live Reloading**: ⚠️ May require manual refresh
- **Application Features**: ✅ All features work normally

The core application functionality (vet bookings, user authentication, pet management) continues to work perfectly regardless of HMR issues.
