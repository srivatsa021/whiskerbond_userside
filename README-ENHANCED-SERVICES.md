# Enhanced Services System with Provider Integration

This document describes the enhanced services system that now includes full business provider integration with the `busers` collection.

## Overview

The services system has been enhanced to provide comprehensive business provider information for each service listing. Services are now properly linked to their business providers through ObjectId references, displaying complete business details alongside service information.

## Architecture Changes

### Backend Enhancements

#### Database Structure
- **Service Collections**: Each category collection (trainers, grooming, etc.) contains service documents
- **Provider References**: Services can include `providerId`, `businessId`, or `buserId` fields referencing the `busers` collection
- **Business Provider Collection**: `busers` collection stores complete business information

#### Enhanced API Response
The `/api/services` endpoint now returns enriched data including:

```javascript
